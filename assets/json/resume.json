    "summary": "I am an individual with a passion for learning things that can help people.\nSince my early years, I have been keenly interested in technology, programming, and mathematics. At 14, I joined the Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ), where I gained experience as a teaching assistant and project leader even before starting my undergraduate studies.\nDuring my technical course, I focused on structural analysis, computational mechanics, and robotics.\nI was the captain and founding member of the leading drone team in the state of Rio de Janeiro, ranking 8th nationally in the Formula Drone SAE Brazil competition, with about 50 competitors.\nDuring this time, I also participated in several national knowledge olympiads and received numerous awards, notably in the OBMEP, the world's largest student olympiad, reaching over 18 million students and more than 47,000 schools.\nI have some experience in creating educational materials such as courses and textbooks.\nAt FGV, I have fully embraced teaching opportunities and have two years of experience as a teaching assistant.\nFor two years, I have been part of the Scientific Initiation and Master's Program, meaning that upon completing my undergraduate degree, I will have fulfilled the credits required for a master's degree, with only the thesis remaining.\nIn terms of research, I have been working on Gaussian Processes under the supervision of  Professor Luiz Max de Carvalho.\nFurthermore, since February 2023, I have been temporarily employed as a consultant and research assistant for The World Bank during a 1-year project, where I engaged in data collection and processing, as well as the implementation and adjustment of econometric models using PyTorch.",

Currently, we are handling a dataset comprising tens of millions of entries, for which I am also responsible for data cleaning and processing. I primarily use PyTorch for scalability with NVIDIA CUDA. This contract is expected to last until April 2024.",

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
