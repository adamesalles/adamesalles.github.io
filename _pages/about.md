My goal is to learn what can help people.

Currently, I'm a graduate student at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) of the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV EMAp).
Also, I'm a research assistant at the [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home).

My interest is in the intersection of data science, statistics and stochastic processes. Joining these fields, I've worked on Gaussian processes and their applications in emulating functions, and now I'm working on exact methods for sampling from historical data models under the supervision of [Professor Luiz Max de Carvalho](https://github.com/maxbiostat/) and co-supervision of [Professor Flávio B. Gonçalves](https://est.ufmg.br/~fbgoncalves/)

Please, check out my [CV](https://adamesalles.github.io/cv) for more information.

If I can help you with anything, feel free to contact me.
