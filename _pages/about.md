I am an individual with a passion for learning things that can help people.

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) of the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV EMAp). Also, I'm a research assistant at the [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home).

My interest is in the intersection of data science, statistics and stochastic processes. Joining these fields, I'm working on Gaussian processes and their applications in emulating functions.

Please, check out my [CV](./cv) for more information.

If I can help you with anything, feel free to contact me.
